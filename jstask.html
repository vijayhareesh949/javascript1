      <summary> variables in javascript </summary>
    <pre>
 Variables are "containers" for storing information.
 JavaScript variables are used to hold values or expressions.
 A variable can have a short name, like x, or a more descriptive name, like carname. <br>
       
 Rules for JavaScript variable names:
 Variable names are case sensitive (y and Y are two different variables) 
 Variable names must begin with a letter or the underscore character 
 Note: Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, variable names are case-sensitive.

 <b>The variables declared using the var keyword are hoisted at the top and are initialized before the execution of code with a default value of undefined. 
 The variables declared in the global scope that is outside any function cannot be deleted </b>
</pre>

<p>
    In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are  <b>var, let, and const</b>. 
</p>
   <h3>Let key word</h3>
<p>javaScript let is a keyword used to declare variables in JavaScript that are block scoped.  <br> <br>

    The variables which are declared inside the { } block are known as block-scoped variables. variables declared by the var keyword cannot be block-scoped.
</p>

<p>
<h3>const keyword</h3>
The difference in const variable declaration to others is that it cannot be re-assigned.
<h3>properties in const key word.</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Cannot be reassigned.</li>
 <li>Its Block Scope</li>
 <li>It can be assigned to the variable on the declaration line.</li>
 <li>Its a Primitive value.</li>
 <li>The property of a const object can be changed but it cannot be changed to a reference to the new object</li>
 <li>The values inside the const array can be changed, it can add new items to const arrays but it cannot reference a new array.</li>
 <li>Re-declaring of a const variable inside different block scopes is allowed.</li>
 <li>Cannot be Hoisted</li>
 <li>Creates only read-only references to value.</li>
</ol>

   <summary>Data types</summary> 

    Datatypes are basically types of data that can be used and manipulated in a program. <br>

    there are two data types <br>
 <div class="pt">    1.Primitive data type.(we can also called as immutable)</div>
     <div>The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known as primitive data type.</div>
       <div> <b>1.number</b>( Number data type in javascript can be used to hold decimal values as well as values without decimals.)</div>

      <div><b>2.string</b>(The string data type in javascript represents a sequence of characters that are surrounded by single or double quotes.)</div>
     <div><b>3.boolean</b>(The boolean data type can accept only two values i.e. true and false.)</div>
     <div><b>4.undefined</b>(The meaning of undefined is ‘value is not assigned’.)</div>
     <div><b>5.null</b>(This data type can hold only one possible value that is null.)</div>

     </div>
    
    <br>

<div class="np">
    2.non-primitive data types.(we can als called as mutable) 
<div>They are two types of non non-primitive data types.</div>
<div><b>1.array</b>( A special type of object used for storing an ordered list of values. Elements in an array can be of any data type.)</div>
<div><b>2.object</b>(Represents complex data structures and is used for collections of data, functions, or methods. Objects are key-value pairs, where the keys are strings (or Symbols) and the values can be any data type.)</div>
<div><b>3.functions</b>(Functions are objects, and they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. Functions are used to perform specific tasks or calculations.)</div>
